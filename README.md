# Calculator

A project for practicing basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript usage. This project was created for the Foundations course in The Odin Project.

The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. Operations can be chained together to perform calculations on results from previous operations. Pressing the "C" button will clear the calculator memory.
